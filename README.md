- 📈 Analyzing data to uncover hidden patterns in Commercial, Analytics, Product Management and Service.
- 💡 Exploring innovative ways to apply AI and ML in real-world scenarios.

## 🌱 Lifelong Learner

I believe in the power of continuous learning. Beyond data science, I'm diving into:
- ⚛️ Quantum computing to understand its potential in solving complex problems in future.
- 🧠 Delving into neuroscience, aiming to contribute to better treatments for neurological disorders.
- 📡 Learning about AR/VR technology and its applications.

## 🛠️ Tech Toolbox

I wield an array of tools and technologies, including:

I have spend <100 hours on updating this Github profile and its still under construction. More Importantly, I have not created this page to showcase my programming skills, ML etc., hence that can be easily automated or take over by AI in next few years. So, I'm mainly here focusing on the ideas & brainstorming & concepts to leverage the best human centric AI in coming years. Join me on this data-driven journey as we navigate the ever-evolving world of technology and knowledge. 🚀🌍. Thanks for reading.
