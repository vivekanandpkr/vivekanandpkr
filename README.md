I'm still new here, have spend <100 hours on updating this Github space and its still under construction. More Importantly, I'm mainly focusing on the ideas, brainstorming & concepts to leverage the best human centric AI, but not here to showcase my programming skills, machine learning models etc., which can be easily automated or taken over by AI in next few years.. Join me on this data-driven journey as we navigate the ever-evolving world of technology and knowledge. Thanks for reading.
